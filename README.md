If you have a [Transcend Wi-fi SD card](http://uk.transcend-info.com/Products/No-401), you'll love this one. Put the card on the "Internet mode", power on your camera and set the card's ip number to "settings.sh" file. Then run 

./app.sh

This script uses wi-fi cards authorization issue and downloads photos from camera without username or password. You could make e.g. cron job which downloads automatic all photos from card you power on your camera at home.
